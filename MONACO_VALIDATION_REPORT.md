await monacoIntegration.initialize();

// Create enhanced editor
const editor = monacoIntegration.createEditor(container, {
  content: fileContent,
  filename: "example.ts",
  config: {
    ai: { enabled: true },
    preferences: { autoSave: true },
  },
});
```

### Performance Monitoring

```typescript
import { performanceMonitor } from "@/config/monaco-performance";

// Get performance summary
const summary = performanceMonitor.getOverallPerformanceSummary();

// Get recommendations
const recommendations = performanceMonitor.getPerformanceRecommendations();
```
